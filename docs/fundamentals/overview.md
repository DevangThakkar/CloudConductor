# Understanding CloudConductor

**CloudConductor** requires *four* input configuration files:

  1. [Pipeline graph](Define_pipeline.html) - defines the analysis pipelines as the correct order of the bioinformatics tools 
  2. [Resource kit](Define_input.html#resource-kit) - defines the locations of the tools and the required resources
  3. [Sample Sheet](Define_input.html#sample-sheet) - defines the actual input data that needs to be analyzed
  4. [Platform](Define_platform.html) - defines the configuration for the processing platform.

Every analysis will be defined by these four configuration files.
In the following sections we will explain how to generate these files.
